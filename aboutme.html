 <h2>All About Elisha</h2>
    <p> Hi I’m Elisha Ikhlaus, a senior at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School in Jamaica, NY with a clear goal to build a career in healthcare as an ultrasound technician. I’m drawn to this field because it combines my interest in technology with a strong desire to help others, and I’m excited to make a real difference in people’s lives.

This year, I entered the Congressional App Challenge with Mindful Habits, an app I designed to encourage people to build positive habits through tools like mood tracking, goal-setting, and a fun, gamified experience. Developing Mindful Habits taught me how impactful technology can be in supporting well-being, which is something I hope to carry forward in my healthcare career.

I’m looking forward to the next chapter, ready to use my skills and passion to support patients and work within the medical field. </p>
